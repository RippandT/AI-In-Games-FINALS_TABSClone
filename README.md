## Scenario
A local gang, the Enormous Enterprise, is looking to expand their operations beyond the city. They decide to strike a compound from a rival gang, the Anonymous Alliance, and take over their operations. The Alliance must defend their compound from the oncoming onslaught by the Enterprise.

## Units
**Brawler** - *"With these fists, they will tremble before me!"* <br>
Units who do not require equipment to fight; thus they are empty handed. Punches about four times per attack cycle, not that a single punch do a lot of damage.

**Melee** - *"Ah c\*\*\*, I forgot my sword!"* [*looks at pipe*] *"That'll do!"* <br>
Units who wield a pipe that was laying somewhere in the compound they took with them before they fight. Deals heavy damage but are somehow made of plasticine.

**Gunner** - *"Hope I remember my weapons training!"* <br>
Units who brings a gun to a fistfight. Their bullets don't discriminate. That's all.

**Manager** - *"I'll help you out, IN CASH!"* <br>
Units who chucks money to injured teammates to motivate them to fight, or give papercuts to enemies. They're special cause they're the only ones who don't exclusively deal damage.
